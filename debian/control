Description: Development files for the libjpeg-turbo JPEG library
 The libjpeg-turbo JPEG library is a library for handling JPEG files.
 .
 libjpeg-turbo is a JPEG image codec that uses SIMD instructions (MMX,
 SSE2, NEON) to accelerate baseline JPEG compression and decompression
 on x86, x86-64, and ARM systems.  The libjpeg-turbo JPEG library is
 an API/ABI compatible with the IJG JPEG library.
 .
 This package contains the static library, headers and documentation.
